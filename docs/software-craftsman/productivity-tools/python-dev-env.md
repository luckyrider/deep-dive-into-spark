# Python Dev Env
## Overview

## Python Distribution
Anaconda vs Canopy

## Install Python
* Anaconda is a package manager, an environment manager, and Python distribution that contains a collection of many open source packages. An installation of Anaconda comes with many packages such as numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, and pandas preinstalled and is also the recommended way to install Jupyter Notebooks.
* Conda effectively combines the functionality of pip and virtualenv in a single package, so you do not need virtualenv if you are using conda.. Pip is a package manager, and virtualenv is an environment manager. Conda is both.
