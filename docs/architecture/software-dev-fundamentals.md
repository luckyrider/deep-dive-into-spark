# Software Development Fundamentals

## Overview


## Revolutions

### OO Revolution
Remember that people have been doing object-oriented programming since at least the days of Simula 
in the late 1960s. But OO didn’t become a revolution, and dominant in the mainstream, until the 
1990s. Why then? The reason the revolution happened was primarily that our industry was driven by 
requirements to write larger and larger systems that solved larger and larger problems and exploited 
the greater and greater CPU and storage resources that were becoming available. OOP’s strengths in 
abstraction and dependency management made it a necessity for achieving large-scale software 
development that is economical, reliable, and repeatable.

### Concurrency Revolution
The Free Lunch Is Over. A Fundamental Turn Toward Concurrency in Software. By Herb Sutter

The biggest sea change in software development since the OO revolution is knocking at the door, and 
its name is Concurrency.

### Distributed Computing & Cluster Computing
The golden age of distributed computing.
