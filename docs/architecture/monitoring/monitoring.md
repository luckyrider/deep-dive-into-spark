# Monitoring

## Overview

> Monitoring solutions are typically built around either metrics or log-based sources. Metrics are 
often used to monitor things like system resources and performance because they are easily 
quantified. On the other hand, logs offer a text record of what happened on a system or application.

> Typically, metrics are best used for monitoring, profiling, and alerting.

> Logs give you the extra level of detail necessary for troubleshooting, debugging, support, and auditing.
